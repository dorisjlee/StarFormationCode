Make everything in fc.nml in cgs units [physical]
do the conversion inside read_params

Things in condinit that should be inside readparam


rmax=6.4512 !dimensionless xi units
rho_c=0.02806!rho_c = 1.10e-19 [cgs] /scale_d
dr=0.01!delta xi used to initialize np.arange for the numerical integration
!rc =rr*(boxlen/32.)*0.5194 !converting from grid units to code length units to units of dimensionless xi
rc =rr*0.5194

rho_outside : 1.997E-9 !ideal gas law computed rho_out with T=10^7 K and P_edge = P_out

pressure_outside : 2.57E-3

Inside read param now
