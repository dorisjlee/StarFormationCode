Initial conditions for RAMSES can be generated by calling the fortran routine 
    - call region_condinit(x,q,dx,nn)
- I think what we have to do is simply add/modify "condinit.f90"
- An example of an initial condition is patch/hydro/halo/coninit.f90 
- In addition to create a "patch" these files can be modified: amr/units.f90, hydro/boundana.f90, hydro/condinit.f90, poisson/gravana.f90, poisson/rho_ana.f90, hydro/cooling_fine.f90

- units: don't need to change this for now.
- condinit: What is "primitive variable vector"? 
    - stuff you can do:
        - add additional gravity_param (What is this?) 
        - user defining a bunch these stuff:
            integer:: i,j,id,iu,iv,iw,ip
            real(dp):: x0,y0,z0,rc,rs,xx,yy,zz,r0,rcut
            But I'm not too sure what these are..
- boundana: 
    - Ghost regions are extra cells around the grids for intergrid communication and better updating. So things stays continous.


- Looking at the condinit for orz tang test, they seem to be setting up the initial condition for the magnetic vector potential A along the radial and the "l" (?) direction.
        Not sure why they had to do  this four times (l.48-59)
