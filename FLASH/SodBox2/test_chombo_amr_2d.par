#The default refine_cutoff_1 value of 0.8 leads to non-convergence

#Dan believes that the problem is because of fine-coarse interpolation
#in a region of the domain where there are sharp features.  Tagging more
#cells avoids the troublesome fine-coarse boundary over sharp features.
#Dan says flux conservation will help with convergence, but the real
